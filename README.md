# Cut to the Case App Design Resources for Developers

This is the design resources of the Cut to the Case App that I designed at Hack4Impact. Essentially everything on the mockups is converted to CSS properties for developers to view and copy, which can make the design to development workflow a lot more streamlined. The original design Sketch files are stored privately on Google Drive.
